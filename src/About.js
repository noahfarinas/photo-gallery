            Sup! My name is Noah, Iâ€™m a new transplant of Seattle, follower of
            Jesus, part time food connoisseur, and husband to my lovely wife,
            Elissa! Other than photos, in my free time I like to think I'm a
            runner, hiker, crossfitter, and chef. I binge watched Blacklist, New
            Girl, The League, Parks & Recreation (not a fan of The Office), This
            Is Us, and Parenthood. Let's take some photos and grab a beer!
