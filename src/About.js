            Sup! My name is Noah, Iâ€™m a new transplant of Seattle, follower of
            Jesus, part time food connoisseur, and husband to my lovely wife,
            Elissa! I started taking photos in 2016 under my friend, Louie
            (follow him on IG Louiemarkambata). After a year of shadowing, I
            finally booked my first full year of weddings, engagements, and
            maternity sessions in 2017. Other than photos, in my free time I
            like to think I'm a runner, hiker, crossfitter, and chef. I binge
            watched Blacklist, New Girl, The League, Parks & Recreation (not a
            fan of The Office), This Is Us, and Parenthood. Let's take some
            photos and grab a beer!
